# Trees-finalRevision

algorithms:

## PreOrder/ PostOrder/ InOrder traversals:
- make sure that root exists
- define array, push to the array, return the array.
- the traversal will be such that the push to the array depends on the "prefix"


## breadth first traversal
-  define two arrays one to push nodes to and then reuse them in traversals
- one to push the values to
